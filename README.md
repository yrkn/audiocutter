# audio cutting tool in unity

It is designed to allow you to trim and save audio files as you wish, without the need for any third-party applications within Unity. 
- This tool works smoothly with all Unity versions from 2018 onwards, with no version restrictions. I don't guarantee compatibility for versions prior to 2018.
- You can contact me via Discord(yrkn) for any suggestions.
